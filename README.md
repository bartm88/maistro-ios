## TODO

Take user taps as input and update the UI accordingly.

Evaluate user passage against target passage.

Make the Evaluation Chart actually nice (radio graph)

Take midi notes as input and update the UI accordingly.

Take raw audio as input and update the UI accordingly.

Acommodate multiple notes at once (polyphony)

Ties across measures on different lines look terrible.

Multiple notes at once will need some better thinking for rhythm matching (comparing start times of notes in an ordered list doesn't work)
